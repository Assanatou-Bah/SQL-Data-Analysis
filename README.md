# 🛍️ Sales Data Exploration using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a sales database using SQL. It focuses on understanding the structure of the database, analyzing customer and product dimensions, and uncovering insights through data segmentation and aggregation.

## 📄 Description
The project uses a sales database to perform end-to-end exploratory data analysis. It begins with exploring the database schema using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, followed by querying customer, product and sales tables to identify unique values, trends, and sales patterns. Using SQL functions like joins, aggregates, and window functions, the project extracts valuable insights such as top-performing products, customer distribution by region, and key sales metrics. 

The goal is to uncover patterns that can inform business decisions such as identifying profitable customer segments or high-performing product categories, by using well-structured SQL queries.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

## 🗂️ Files Used
The following CSV files were used as source data and imported into Microsoft SQL Server:
- `sales.csv` – contains transactional sales records  
- `customers.csv` – includes customer details and demographics  
- `products.csv` – provides product categories, subcategories, and names
